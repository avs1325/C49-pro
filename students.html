        <p> When I first joined CIS I couldn’t fit in, I felt like I didn’t belong here. </p>
        <p> But as time passed this school has taught me the importance of individuality in true sense. </p>
        <p> You don’t need to be similar to fit here, you need to be different. </p>
        <p> Just one year in this school has taught me about self-discipline, perseverance and responsibility. </p>
        <p> It has given me opportunities to explore and pursue what fascinates me and more importantly it has helped me with my pursuit. </p>

        <p> What I like best about CIS is the individual attention that the teachers and staff gives the students. </p>
        <p> Teachers are not only interested in my academic progress but are also interested in my growth as an individual and have always been around to give advice and to support me. </p>
        <p> There are great facilities and a friendly atmosphere. CIS organises multiple events each year which has made my time here really enjoyable. </p>
        <p> There is always something to do at school as there are a wide range of extra curricular activities that one can participant in. </p>
